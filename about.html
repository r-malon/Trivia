		Trivia is a type of game in which players (who can play individually or in a team) are asked questions about different topics and they have to get as many correct answers as possible. Each correct answer will award you 1 point, each wrong answer will take 1 point away. The next is automatically loaded, after choosing an option, so choose wisely. If you don't want to answer a question, skip it. If you get an error, just skip the question or reload the page.<br>
		Don't forget to change the settings!
